This project utilizes a Scrapy spider to efficiently extract grades from our academic disciplines, providing a streamlined approach to gather essential data. Integrated with a user-friendly GUI, users can easily visualize and monitor their academic progress.

If the login credentials are incorrect, the spider will not work :p.
